# Collaborative Notebook Repository
Welcome to this repository! The goal of this project is to centralize all notebooks produced by the team. You can upload your notebooks to the notebooks/ folder.

Guidelines
- Use explicit filenames: temperature_analysis.ipynb, CAMS2024_exploration.ipynb, etc.
- Include a comment or a short description within the notebook.
- If needed, create a subfolder with your name or based on a theme.

# Notebooks Directory

This folder contains Jupyter notebooks contributed by team members. It serves as a centralized space for sharing analyses, experiments, and explorations.

## Contribution Guidelines

- Place your notebooks directly in this folder, or create a subfolder if needed (e.g., based on your name or topic).
- Use **clear and descriptive filenames** (e.g., `sea_surface_temperature_analysis.ipynb`, `cams_data_quality_check.ipynb`).
- Include a **short introduction or comment** at the top of your notebook to explain its purpose.
- Do **not commit large datasets or generated outputs** unless explicitly needed.
- If your notebook requires specific packages, consider adding a `requirements.txt` file in the same subfolder.
